I am using a Galactic Latitude limit of +/-28 deg instead of +/-30 deg, because
fields near the limit may contain stars at latitudes lower than +/-30 deg.
Those stars should be taken into consideration for the overlap tests.

SELECT source_id, ra, dec, phot_rp_mean_mag
FROM gaiadr3.gaia_source_lite
WHERE (
    phot_rp_mean_mag <= 10
    AND (
        b >= 28
        OR b <= -28
        )
    );

SELECT source_id, ra, dec, phot_rp_mean_mag
FROM gaiadr3.gaia_source_lite
WHERE (
    phot_rp_mean_mag <= 11
    AND phot_rp_mean_mag > 10
    AND (
        b >= 28
        OR b <= -28
        )
    );

NOTE: mag 14 query resulted in 3M sources. Is there a 3M query return limit? This number is suspicious.
